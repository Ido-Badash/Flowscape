# Settings Page Expanded Widgets Problem

## Problem
The problem is in the settings page.  
When I ran it in Windows or Chrome mode, it's fine,  
but in mobile, the settings page is not expanding as it should,  
and I get an overflow problem.

## Ideas on How to Fix
1. Try looking up online for this problem and how to solve it.  
2. Look for a widget that can only contain within the screen  
    and wrap it around the Expanded widget.  
3. Final resort: Use Copilot.

## Steps
1. create a new branch of the settings branch
2. fix the problem
3. run the app (in windows and mobile)
4. merge to settings branch
