# Settings Page Expanded Widgets Problem

## Problem
The problem is in the settings page.  
When I ran it in Windows or Chrome mode, it's fine,  
but in mobile, the settings page is not expanding as it should,  
and I get an overflow problem.

## Ideas on How to Fix
1. Try looking up online for this problem and how to solve it.
2. Look for a widget that can only contain within the screen  
   and wrap it around the Expanded widget.  
3. Final resort: Use Copilot.
